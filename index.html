    <h2>Who is Blagica?</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>Blagica Chadamova</strong>, a 20-year-old student at the <strong>Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI)</strong> in Skopje. Originally from Kavadarci, I combine my passion for technology with strong leadership and creative skills.</p>

    <p>Throughout my academic journey at Goce Delchev Primary School and Dobri Daskalov Gymnasium, I've demonstrated excellence in my studies and won awards for my business plan in Business & Management. My public speaking experience includes delivering speeches at my municipality, city library, and high school.</p>

    <p>I thrive in team environments and excel under pressure, bringing strong organizational and leadership qualities to every project. My ability to plan effectively and communicate clearly makes me a valuable asset in both academic and professional settings.</p>

    <p>Beyond academics, I'm passionate about dancing, drawing, and exploring new cultures through travel. My experiences in Italy and France have broadened my perspective and enhanced my creativity.</p>

    <p>Driven by curiosity and a commitment to personal growth, I approach every challenge with focus and dedication. Whether it's a technical project or creative endeavor, I bring professionalism and attention to detail to all my work.</p>
